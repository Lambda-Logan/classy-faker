# Classy-Faker

Classy-Faker is a [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) library that generates fake data for you. Classy-Faker sets it self apart from other similar libraries by focusing on having a large array of fake, yet accurately structured, fake data that can be used for mocking, testing, or development.

This project is still in its early stages.
